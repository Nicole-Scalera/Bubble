Date: 1/30/25

- Paul drew up a prototype of the new first level, which is the bathroom.
     - Tile background with bathtub.
     - This can be adjusted in the future, but he will upload it to the GitHub for reference.
- Nikki explained the current UI position to Paul, let him know that she will get back to him about what the exact size the backgrounds should be.
     - Nikki explained that she needs to play around with the camera and UI canvases.
- Paul suggested that the obstacles/enemies can be static, but can also move side-to-side.
- Nikki informed Paul that we need a new logo for the game.
- Also need Level Design. Paul said he can start working on level design for the bathroom.
